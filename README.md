# Frontend-one
Frontend project that involves using HTML and CSS to build a responsive website.


## Project Description
In this project I create a dummy website for a fictional shoe e-commerce company called MyKicks.


## Technologies used
* HTML
* CSS


## Design


The landing page in the HTML page contains three sections: 
            1)  The Header
            2)  The Body
            3)  The Footer


* ### The Header 
In the header section I added the website logo, clickable links for navigation to different pages and a Button. The styling was done using CSS.

The website is fully responsive and adapts to any screen size.


* ### The Body 
The Body contains descriptive text about the fictional e-commerce website and why customers should shop there.

Along with the descriptive text is a slider that contains featured products and their descriptions where users can scroll through to identify features of choice.

To crown it all off is the footer that contains navigation, links, contact information, social media links, and copyright.
